* Puzzle Game
Player moves pieces within constraints, board matches the moves. This repo contains a library
(puzzle-game) and a very basic demo to print the board, as well as a unit test suite.
** Prerequesites
   - gtest and gtest_main (available in most distros)
   - gtest_main
   - ninja (preferred) or make
** To build on Linux
   See the ci_build shell script.
** To build on Windows
   Haven't tested this repo yet, but since we're using cmake, it should be possible to download the
   Windows cmake generator to create Visual Studio solutions. Alternatively, it's probably also
   possible to build this in WSL.
